What?

![Caddis Fly Lure](http://custardbelly.com/images/caddis.jpg)  
A caddis is a moth-like insect often used as models for fly lures in fishing.

The [caddis](https://github.com/bustardcelly/caddis) CLI tool is used to start and stop a RESTful JSON service with the ability to POST route configuration and responses, on-the-fly, for mocking and testing purposes.

_It may be a stretch, but there's wit in there somewhere..._

Why?
---
There are other projects I have been a part of, such as [madmin](https://github.com/infrared5/madmin), that allow for dynamically creating RESTful APIs through a User Interface and allows for persistance through I/O.

Recently, I was involved with mocking a service layer for unit testing purposes and found that the manual curation of such an API was too tedious for the task at hand - I wanted the process to be much more fluid and simple.

In this particular instance I needed to:

1. Start a server in setup/before
2. Dynamically add a route to the service with mock JSON response
3. Run the test
4. Shut down the server in teardown/after

Fairly simple, and most of all I didnt want any artifacts lying around - in other words I didn't need for any routes that I dynamically created to stick around on my local disk after the tests were done.

As such, [caddis](https://github.com/bustardcelly/caddis) was born.

How
---
As mentioned briefly above, [caddis](https://github.com/bustardcelly/caddis) is a CLI tool. It is recommended to install globally:

```
$ npm install -g caddis
```
_: you may need to `sudo`_

Once installed, you can start the service (currently defaults to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)) and begin POSTing route configurations in JSON. Here is an example using cUrl that dynamically adds a GET route at `/foo` with a simple JSON payload of `{"bar":"baz"}`:

```
$ curl -X POST -d '{"method":"GET", "uri":"/foo", "response":{"bar":"baz"}}' http://localhost:3001/api --header "Content-Type:application/json"
```

You are not confiuned to cUrl - you can use whatever networking library in whatever language you are writing your tests in and the server can handle all modern RESTful methods:

* GET
* POST
* PUT
* DELETE

When you are finished, simply stop the [caddis](https://github.com/bustardcelly/caddis) server:

```
$ caddis stop
```

## Post Data
The post body data that is sent to [caddis](https://github.com/bustardcelly/caddis) has the following properties:

* __method__: The REST method
* __uri__: The endpoint of the service to hit (requires prepended '/')
* __response__: The JSON object to return on request
* __statusCode__: [Optional] Status code to return. Defaults to 200
* __delay__: [Optional] Time delay, in milliseconds, to delay response. Defaults to NaN
